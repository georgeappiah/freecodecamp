        <h1>WordPress&reg; In Ten Minutes</h1>

        <p><span class="dropcap">U</span>nless you've been living under a giant rock in a cave in the last couple of years, you've no doubt heard about this online publishing software called WordPress. Maybe your own website or blog is built with WordPress, or you even make a living building, hosting or supporting WordPress-powered websites for others.</p>

        <p>From its beginning as basic blogging software, the WordPress software has evolved to become a general purpose contentment management system and web application platform, powering more than a third of all the websites on the Internet.</p>
        
        <p>In this short WordPress primer, we'll go over the humble beginning of this amazing software, and explore how to build, host, and manage a fast and secure WordPress website. Let's jump right in!</p>

        <header>In The Beginning</header>
        

        <p>WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. WordPress was birthed in 2003 when <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> and <strong>Mike Little</strong> forked the b2/cafelog open source blogging software to create WordPress.</p>


        <p>To use it, WordPress has to be installed on a web server supporting MySQL and PHP. While Apache and Nginx are recommended by the WordPress developers as <em>"the most robust and featureful server for running WordPress"</em>, any server that supports PHP and MySQL should be able to host WordPress.</p>

        <p>In 2019, even the cheapest shared hosting company out there is more likely than not to support these basic requirements.</p>

        <p>WordPress is a general purpose content management system used by millions of people for different purposes. In order to cater for the varying needs of a 3rd of online publishers who WordPress without ending up with highly bloated software that everyone hates, a three-legged approached was adopted early on in the development of the software.</p>

        <p>The base WordPress software, also called the <em>WordPress Core</em>, is developed by a team of volunteers from all over the world who collaborate online. The core is the foundation of any WordPress site and provides all the <em>core</em> or standard features needed by all users, such as page creation, content editing, user authentication and management, file and media management, etc.</p>

        <p>The second leg of a WordPress site is the <em>WordPress theme</em>, which governs the presentation or design of a WordPress site. The third and final leg is the <em>WordPress plugin</em>, which adds additional features and functionality to cater to the varying needs of different WordPress users.</p>

    <section id="WordPress_Themes" class="main-section">
        <header>WordPress Themes</header>
        <p>WordPress users may install and switch among different themes. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content.</p>

        <p>Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present and every theme should be designed using WordPress standards with structured PHP, valid HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>

        <p>Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress "Appearance" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via FTP or web-based control panel.</p>

        <p>WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory, and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers.</p>

        <p>WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.</p>

    <section id="WordPress_Plugins" class="main-section">
        <header>WordPress Plugins</header>

        <p>WordPress' plugin architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of this writing (May 10th, 2019), WordPress.org has over 555,000 plugins available in its official database, each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.</p> 

        <p>However, this does not include the commercial plugins that are available elsewhere, which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from search engine optimization to client portals used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation bars.</p>

        <p>Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result, they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through the official WordPress plugin database, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via FTP or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.</p>

        <p>Web developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.</p>

        <p>To use WordPress, it has to be installed on a web server supporting MySQL and PHP. Apache and Nginx are recommended by the WordPress developers as "the most robust and featureful server for running WordPress". But any server that supports PHP and MySQL should be able to host WordPress just fine.</p>

        <p>There are hundreds of thousands of web hosts out there, ranging from generic shared web hosting services to specialist WordPress hosting providers, which meet these WordPress minimum requirements.</p>

        <p>For users people who prefer to focus on their business and website content and not worry about the technical stuff that go into running their websites, WordPress.com, a company run by WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg, provides a "hosted WordPress" or WordPress-as-a-service that takes away all the technical complexity, giving users a ready-to-use WordPress website after just a few clicks.</p>

    <header>WordPress Security</header>
        <p>Success comes with a cost. For WordPress, that cost is increased attacks from never-do-gooders. With tens of millions of installations, many of them unmanaged, out of date and vulnerable, WordPress websites have become attractive targets to kiddie hackers who like to hack and deface websites for the bragging rights, and to criminals who commandeer vulnerable websites and use them for their criminal activities.</p>

        <p>When it comes to WordPress security, there are a lot of things you can do to lock down your site to prevent hackers and vulnerabilities from affecting your website or blog. The last thing you want to happen is to wake up one morning to discover your site in shambles. Luckily, there are simple tips, strategies, and techniques you can use to secure your WordPress and stay protected.</p>

        <p>The official documentation page, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress">Hardening WordPress</a> would be the first place to start if you want to secure your WordPress blog or website. This page has an excellent primer on the various aspects of security to consider (including your own personal computer that you use to access your WordPress website!), as well as specific recommendations and to take to secure your website. The page also includes a link to WordPress security plugins and 3rd-party protection services that can be used to provide additional layers of security for your WordPress website.</p>

    <header>WordPress Management</header>
        <p>WordPress core, WordPress themes, and WordPress plugins must be updated as soon as possible whenever new versions are released by their developers. Developers routinely release new versions of their products to:</p> 
        
        <ul>
        <li>fix bugs</li>
        <li>add new features</li>
        <li>address security concerns</li>
        <li>improve performance</li>
        <li>... etc</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Even with a single website, tracking, testing and implementing all the updates can become a chore, especially for people who are not techies and have their businesses to run and their lives to live. And if you have two or more websites, the management burden increases exponentially.</p>

        <p>Luckily, and as you'd probably expect, there are WordPress plugins that make managing a WordPress website easier. There are also specialized WordPress hosting services and 3rd-party services site management services that will do all the WordPress site management chores for you, leaving you to focus 100% on your business.</p>

        <p>Every now and then you're going to run into issues, and you're going to need a helping hand to keep your WordPress website functioning smoothly. In other words, you're going to need WordPress support. And the good thing is, there's plenty of both free and low-cost support available.</p>

        <p>No matter how you skin this cat, WordPress has been a phenomenal success, powering and providing livelihoods, directly and indirectly, to millions of people around the world.</p>

        <p>WordPress is by no means perfect; not as a software, and certainly not in its governance as an open source project. But, tell me, what is?</p>
