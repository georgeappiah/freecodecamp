    <p>Most histrory buffs and film enthusiasts would know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Hedy Lamarr</a> (November 9, 1914 – January 19, 2000) as an Austrian and American film actress who appeared in numerous popular feature films, including <em>Algiers</em> (1938), <em>I Take This Woman</em>  (1940), <em>Comrade X</em> (1940), <em>Come Live With Me</em> (1941), <em>H.M. Pulham, Esq.</em> (1941), and <em>Samson and Delilah</em> (1949).</p>

    <p>But not many people know Lamarr was also an inventor, and that a communication technique she helped to invent is at the heart of the cellular phones, wi-fi devices, and other wireless communications systems in widespead use today.</p>

    <p>Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught, she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions, which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink.
  The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like Alka-Seltzer.</p>

 <p>During World War II, Lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes, which could be important in the naval war, could easily be jammed, thereby causing the torpedo to go off course. With the knowledge she had gained about torpedoes from her first husband,
  she came up with the idea of somehow creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed.</p>

 <p> She contacted her friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, to help her develop a device for doing that, and he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals. They drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system
  which they patented.</p>

 <p>Their invention was granted a patent on August 11, 1942 (filed using her married name Hedy Kiesler Markey). However, it was technologically difficult to implement, and at that time the U.S. Navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from
  outside the military. Only in 1962 (at the time of the Cuban missile crisis) did an updated version of their design appear on Navy ships.</p>

 <p>The "Secret Communications System" has since been in extensive use in military communications. But most importantly, their patent also catalyzed the use of Spread Spectrum, which is a highly efficient way of using radio frequencies at the same time,
  without interferring with each other. This is the basis for the cellular phones, wi-fi devices, and other wireless communications systems in widespead use today.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Unfortunately, the patent expired in 1959 -- three years before the military could put the technique to use and long before any civilian implementation. As a result, neither Lamarr nor her friend Antheil ever received any compensation for their patent.</em></strong></p>

 <p>In 1997, Lamarr and Antheil received the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award</strong> and the <strong>Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award</strong>, given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts, sciences,
  business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society. She was featured on the Science Channel and the Discovery Channel. In 2014, Lamarr and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</p>

 <p><strong>So, next time you pick your smartphone to make or receive a call, think of Hedy Lamarr -- the inventor the world forgot to pay.</strong></p>
